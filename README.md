# The Portal 2 Workshop Authors Rankings
A single page web app that lists the members of [ThinkingWithPortals Mapping](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/portalmapping), a Steam group related to Portal 2 custom map development and also members from several other groups, such as: [P2LC](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/P2LC), [Portal Two's Creator's](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/portal2mapcreator) and others. The rankings includes only those authors (map creators) who have at least 5 followers. Authors can be ranked by the number of followers, the number of submitted workshop items or the number of Portal 2 cooperative maps (by default they are sorted by name).

The backend is built with Django 3.2 and uses the Steam API and BeautifulSoup to collect authors' data. The collected data is stored in a PostgreSQL database and is updated once a week by using [APScheduler](https://apscheduler.readthedocs.io/en/3.0/). Bootstrap is used for frontend.
